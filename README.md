# Predicting Customer Churn

## Problem Statement

The Predicting Customer Churn project aims to develop an accurate model for predicting customer churn in a subscription-based service. By engineering meaningful features from customer behavior data, this project empowers businesses to proactively address customer attrition and enhance customer retention strategies.

## Dataset

For this project, I created a synthetic dataset that includes customer attributes and transaction history. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and validating our customer churn prediction model.

## AWS Integration

The Predicting Customer Churn project seamlessly integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to leverage advanced tools and capabilities:

- **AWS Glue for Data Preparation**: I utilized AWS Glue for efficient data preparation and transformation. This service streamlines data processing, ensuring high-quality data for model training.

- **Amazon Redshift for Data Storage**: The processed data is stored in Amazon Redshift, a powerful data warehousing solution. Amazon Redshift facilitates comprehensive data analysis, enabling businesses to derive actionable insights.

## Deployment on AWS

The project's culmination is the deployment of a web-based dashboard using Amazon QuickSight. This dashboard serves as a central hub for monitoring and visualizing churn predictions in real-time. It empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions to retain customers effectively.
